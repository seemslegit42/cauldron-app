# Enhanced AI Reasoning Chain and Prompt History

This document explains how to use the enhanced AI reasoning chain and prompt history schema for tracking raw prompts, AI reasoning chains, and response trees. This system is designed for transparency, auditing, and supervised fine-tuning.

## Schema Overview

The enhanced schema builds upon the existing AI tracking models with additional fields and relationships:

### Enhanced AIReasoning Model

The `AIReasoning` model has been enhanced with:

- `reasoningChain`: Structured chain-of-thought reasoning
- `confidenceScore`: Overall confidence score (0-1)
- `executionGraph`: Execution graph for complex reasoning
- `contextSources`: Sources of context used in reasoning
- `alternativePaths`: Alternative reasoning paths considered
- Relations to new models: `reasoningSteps`, `contextItems`, `evaluations`

### New Models

- **AIReasoningStep**: Tracks individual steps in the reasoning process
- **AIContextItem**: Tracks context used in reasoning
- **AIEvaluation**: Tracks quality metrics for reasoning
- **AIPromptSafetyCheck**: Tracks safety evaluations for prompts
- **AIResponseAnnotation**: Allows for feedback and corrections on responses

### Enhanced AIPrompt Model

The `AIPrompt` model has been enhanced with:

- `promptVersion`: Version tracking for prompt evolution
- `promptHash`: Hash for deduplication and reference
- `parentPromptId`: For tracking prompt evolution
- `derivedFromId`: For tracking prompt derivation
- `usageStats`: Statistics on prompt usage
- Relations to new models: `parentPrompt`, `childPrompts`, `derivedFrom`, `derivatives`, `safetyChecks`

### Enhanced AIResponseNode Model

The `AIResponseNode` model has been enhanced with:

- `sourceReasoningStep`: Reference to the reasoning step that generated this
- `confidenceScore`: Confidence score for this specific node
- `alternativeResponses`: Alternative responses considered
- Relations to new models: `annotations`

### Enhanced AISession Model

The `AISession` model has been enhanced with:

- `sessionPurpose`: Purpose of this session
- `businessContext`: Business context for this session
- `sessionTags`: Tags for categorizing sessions
- `qualityScore`: Overall quality score for the session
- `userSatisfaction`: User satisfaction score
- `learningOutcomes`: What was learned from this session

        source: 'chat_history',
        relevanceScore: 0.8,
      },
      {
        contextType: 'database_record',
        content: 'Healthcare market data from the last 6 months',
        source: 'market_database',
        relevanceScore: 0.95,
      }
    ],
    reasoningChain: {
      initialThought: 'Need to understand the healthcare market trends',

const safetyCheck = await EnhancedReasoningService.createPromptSafetyCheck({
  promptId: promptId,
  checkType: 'toxicity',
  score: 0.02,
  passed: true,
  details: {
    categories: {
      hate: 0.01,
      harassment: 0.02,
      self_harm: 0.00,

      violence: 0.01
    }
  }

```typescript
import { EnhancedReasoningService } from '../ai-services/enhancedReasoningService';

// Create a response annotation
const annotation = await EnhancedReasoningService.createResponseAnnotation(
  userId,
  {
    responseNodeId: responseNodeId,
    annotationType: 'improvement',
    content: 'This response could be more concise and focused on the key points.',
    suggestedOutput: 'A more concise version of the response...',
    status: 'pending',
    metadata: {
      priority: 'medium',
      category: 'clarity'
    }
  }
);
```

### Getting a Complete Reasoning Chain

```typescript
import { EnhancedReasoningService } from '../ai-services/enhancedReasoningService';

// Get a complete reasoning chain with all related data
const completeReasoning = await EnhancedReasoningService.getCompleteReasoningChain(reasoningId);

// Access the reasoning steps
const steps = completeReasoning.reasoningSteps;

// Access the context items
const contextItems = completeReasoning.contextItems;

// Access the evaluations
const evaluations = completeReasoning.evaluations;

// Access the response nodes
const responseNodes = completeReasoning.responseNodes;
```
