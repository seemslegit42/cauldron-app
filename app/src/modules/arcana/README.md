### Database Schema
The Arcana module uses the `UserContext` model to store user-specific data:
- `metrics`: JSON data for business metrics
- `projects`: JSON data for active projects
- `decisions`: JSON data for pending decisions
- `goals`: JSON data for user goals
- `persona`: String for the active persona mode

### Components
- `HeroPanel.tsx`: Displays user greeting and top-level metrics
- `KeyMetricsBoard.tsx`: Interactive dashboard with charts and metrics
- `AiPromptAssistant.tsx`: Command-line interface for the Sentient Loop
- `ForgeflowWidget.tsx`: Mini workflow manager
- `SentinelRiskLight.tsx`: Security status indicator
- `AdaptivePersonaMode.tsx`: Persona selector and customizer

### Operations
- `getUserContext`: Fetches user context data
- `updateUserContext`: Updates user context data
- `updateUserPersona`: Updates user persona
- `getSentientRecommendations`: Gets AI-generated recommendations
- `getActiveWorkflows`: Gets active workflows for the Forgeflow widget
- `processCommand`: Processes commands from the AI Prompt Assistant

## Getting Started
