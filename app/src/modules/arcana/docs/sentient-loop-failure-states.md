## 2. Recovery Protocols

### 2.1 Automatic Recovery Protocols

#### 2.1.1 Retry Mechanisms

```typescript
// Implementation pattern for retry logic
async function executeWithRetry<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  delayMs: number = 1000,
  backoffFactor: number = 2
): Promise<T> {
  let lastError: Error | null = null;
  
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error as Error;
      LoggingService.warn({
        message: `Operation failed, retrying (${attempt + 1}/${maxRetries})`,
        category: 'SENTIENT_LOOP',
        error: lastError,
        metadata: { attempt, maxRetries }
      });
      
      // Wait with exponential backoff before retrying
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs * Math.pow(backoffFactor, attempt)));
    }
  }
  
  throw lastError || new Error('Operation failed after maximum retry attempts');
}
```

#### 2.1.2 Fallback Systems

- **Model Fallbacks**: Automatically switch to alternative AI models when primary model fails
- **Endpoint Fallbacks**: Route requests to alternative endpoints when primary is unavailable
- **Local Fallbacks**: Use cached or local responses when cloud services are unavailable
- **Simplified Processing**: Fall back to simpler processing when complex operations fail

#### 2.1.3 Circuit Breakers

- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Automatically disable problematic components when failure rate exceeds threshold
- Gradually test recovery with partial traffic before full restoration

### 2.2 Human Escalation Protocols

#### 2.2.1 Escalation Paths

| Failure Severity | Escalation Path | Response Time SLA |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Low** | System logs only | N/A |
| **Medium** | Team notification | 24 hours |
| **High** | Team lead alert | 4 hours |
| **Critical** | Executive notification | 1 hour |

#### 2.2.2 Escalation Triggers

- **Repeated Failures**: More than 3 failures of the same type within 1 hour
- **Critical Operations**: Any failure in payment, security, or data-critical operations
- **Extended Downtime**: System component unavailable for more than 15 minutes
- **Unusual Patterns**: Anomalous behavior detected in system operations

### 2.3 Recovery Workflows

#### 2.3.1 Task Recovery

1. **Checkpoint Restoration**: Resume from last valid checkpoint
2. **Partial Results Salvaging**: Extract and utilize any valid partial results
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break failed complex task into smaller subtasks
4. **Alternative Approach**: Try alternative method to accomplish the same goal

#### 2.3.2 Decision Recovery

1. **Confidence Threshold Adjustment**: Temporarily lower confidence requirements
2. **Decision Simplification**: Reduce options to simplify decision space
3. **Human Augmentation**: Increase human involvement in decision process
4. **Default Fallback**: Apply pre-defined default decision for the context

#### 2.3.3 Human-in-the-Loop Recovery

1. **Approval Timeout Handling**: Define clear actions for approval timeouts
2. **Escalation Path**: Route to alternative approvers when primary is unavailable
3. **Approval Batching**: Group similar approvals to reduce approval fatigue
4. **Approval Prioritization**: Prioritize critical approvals in the queue

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### 3.1 Monitoring & Detection

```typescript
// Example implementation for timeout detection
function createTimeoutMonitor<T>(
  promise: Promise<T>,
  timeoutMs: number,
  operationName: string
): Promise<T> {
  return Promise.race([
    promise,
    new Promise<T>((_, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const error = new Error(`Operation '${operationName}' timed out after ${timeoutMs}ms`);
        LoggingService.error({
          message: `Timeout detected in operation: ${operationName}`,
          category: 'SENTIENT_LOOP',
          error,
          metadata: { timeoutMs, operationName }
        });
        reject(error);
      }, timeoutMs);
    })
  ]);
}
```

### 3.2 Logging & Telemetry

- Implement comprehensive logging for all failure states
- Include context, operation details, and recovery attempts in logs
- Maintain telemetry for failure rates and recovery success metrics
- Establish alerting thresholds for different failure categories

### 3.3 Testing & Simulation

- Regularly test recovery protocols through chaos engineering
- Simulate various failure scenarios to validate recovery mechanisms
- Conduct regular drills for human escalation procedures
- Review and update recovery protocols based on test results
